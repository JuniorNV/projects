Experiments around the piezeoelectric effect,
both [sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectric_sensor) and transducers.

Piezo elements have an incredibly long [list of common applications](https://www.americanpiezo.com/blog/top-uses-of-piezoelectricity-in-everyday-applications/).

## Piezo preamp

For a capacitive sensor like a piezo element, a [Charge amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_amplifier)
is better than a voltage or current amplifier.

Gain is `G = Cinput / Cfeedback`. It is neccesary to limit the DC amplification using.
And to correct for input bias causing DC offset on output, `R1 == R2`, where R1 is on the negative input connected to.

It may be desirable to add another (voltage) gain stage after the charge-amp, to maybe bring output up to line level.



Parts:

* Opamp: [TL062](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl064.pdf), low power consumption

* Feedback capacitor

Ideas:

* Put double pads on feedback capacitor slot, to allow modifying/testing alternate values
* Can one make a "socket" for SMD capacitors, that allows switching them out?

## Piezo trigger amp

[KiCAD files](./crystaltriggeramp/).

Parts

* Input protection diode, or zener. SOD-123 nice size, around 3.5mm, similar to 1206. Or two diodes in SOT23?

## Piezo driver

* [Speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectric_speaker) and buzzers
* Ultrasound transducer vaperizators, for aeroponics
* Micro-pumps and droplet valves

## Synthetization

There are many recipies to make Rochelle salts, which are piezo-electric.

* [Very detailed](http://www.extremenxt.com/blog/?page_id=77)

Rochell salts are [Potassium sodium tartrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_sodium_tartrate),
which can be purchased directly [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Potassium+sodium+tartrate).

It can also be made from two fairly common ingredients

* [Potassium bitartrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_bitartrate) "Cream of tartar"
* [Sodium carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_carbonate) "soda ash" or "washing soda",
which can be make easily from sodium bicarbonate.

This should be usable for simple piezo sensors, like for triggering samples/drums.

Some cool things could be possible when synthesizing the piezo elements / crystals oneself.
For instance, can possibly create a shape that is needed / desired,
both for astetic effects and to make particular objects. Say like a speaker driver.

One could possibly embed electrical wire, solving the issue of
